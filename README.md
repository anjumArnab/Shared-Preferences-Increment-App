# Shared Preferences Counter App

This is a Flutter project demonstrating the use of the `shared_preferences` package to persist data locally. The app displays a counter, which increments every time a button is pressed, and retains the counter value even after restarting the app.

## Features

- **State Persistence**: Counter value is saved using `shared_preferences` and is loaded when the app starts.
- **Material Design**: Utilizes Material 3 and a color scheme generated from a seed color (`Colors.deepPurple`).
- **Responsive UI**: Displays the counter in a clean, centered layout.
